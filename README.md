## Stage 1: Data Cleaning & Annotation

**Duration:** 15 Dec 2025 – 19 Dec 2025

### Task 1: Detection Error Inspection

We have recorded a set of humanoid facial expression animations and applied **MediaPipe Face Landmarker** to extract facial landmarks and blendshape coefficients. These video data will be used to train models for humanoid facial expression generation. However, we have observed that some detection results are inaccurate or unstable.

*Landmarks around the eyelids are incorrectly detected, as indicated by the red box.*


**Your task:**

* Watch the provided videos carefully.
* Identify several typical detection errors (e.g., misaligned landmarks, unstable eyelid detection, missing facial regions).
* For each identified error:

  * Provide a **screenshot** illustrating the issue.
  * Write a **brief description** explaining what is wrong and why it is problematic for downstream modeling.

📦 **Submission format:**
Please submit **either a PowerPoint (.ppt/.pptx) or a Word document (.doc/.docx)** summarizing:

* Example screenshots of detection errors
* Short explanations for each error case

### Task 2: Sentiment Labeling (Listener Reactions)

**Objective**
Label the *sentiment of the listener* in conversational video clips. You will observe individuals who are listening to someone else speak and annotate their facial expressions and non-verbal reactions.

**Important note:**
Please base your judgment **only on the listener’s reactions**, not on the spoken content or the speaker’s emotions. Our goal is to analyze how listeners *feel* about the information they are receiving.

**Labeling task**
Assign **one** of the following sentiment labels to each video clip:

* **Positive**: The listener appears engaged or pleased (e.g., smiling, nodding, showing agreement or enthusiasm).
* **Negative**: The listener appears confused, displeased, or resistant (e.g., frowning, shaking their head, showing disagreement or disgust).
* **Neutral**: The listener shows minimal emotional expression (e.g., flat affect, calm attention without clear positive or negative cues).

**Additional guidance**

* Videos recorded within the **same session** may exhibit **similar or identical sentiments**. Please label each clip carefully, but keep session-level consistency in mind.
